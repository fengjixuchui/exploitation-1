# DWARF INFORMATION
**what is dwarf?**
- `Debugging With Attributed Record Formats`
- Used to stack unwinding in c/c++

**what is stack unwind?**
- Let's take an example.
```
#include <iostream>
#include <stdio.h>

using namespace std;

void f3(void){
  throw 10;
}

void f2(void){
  f3();
}

void f1(void){
  f2();
}

int main(void){
  try{
    f1();
  }
  catch(int e){
    printf("got exception : %d\n", e);
  }
}
```

- If i throw some value, it backtrace stack frame, find last catch statement.
- In above example code, throw statement is in the f3().
- Function flow is main() -> f1() -> f2() -> f3().
- So, catch statement is not defined in f3(), f2() and f1(), it has to backtrace from f3() to main().
- To successfully backtrace, DWARF information is needed, which placed in .eh_frame section or .debug_frame section.

**CFI? CIE? FDE?**
- CFI is Call Frame Information, which is information to stack backtrace( stack unwind ).
- CFI record information about stack frame on special section in each function.
- In CFI, CFA ( Canocical Frame Address ) is used to represent current function start frame pointer.
```
.cfi_def_cfa           <reg, ofs>
.cfi_def_cfa_register  <reg>
.cfi_def_cfa_offset    <ofs>
.cfi_offset    <reg, ofs>
```
- DIE is Debugging Information Entry, which means
