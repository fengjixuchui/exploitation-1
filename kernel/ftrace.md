# mcount hooking
**One of hooking mechnisms**
- complier level function -> ABI
- if compile with gcc -pg option, mcount brench code is inserted
- if developer can code some wanted routine in mcount function, hook is not hard.
- ftrace use this mechnism and, by revising mcount internal routine, it can trace 
internal kernel function.
